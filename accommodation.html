                <h6>International Participants</h6>
                <p>After participants have completed the online registration procedure, a room reservation form will be accessible on the registration page.  Please make your reservation at the Dong Hua Guest House with the provided form.  Discounts are offered to BioPro2015 participants using the room reservation form provided by the BioPro2015 Summer School.
                    </br>Since the availability is limited and varies with room types (as shown above), we suggest that all participants book their room as early as possible.  We have also compiled some possible off-campus accommodations here<!--(請加上民宿資料)-->, however, those staying at places other than Dong Hua Guest House will need to be responsible for their breakfast and own transportation to and from the venue.  The degree of English service available is also varied.</p>
                <p>Our staff will assist you in in the booking procedure.  Please fill in the room reservation form provided on the registration page (please login first), and send it to the contact person listed below via e-mail.  We will reserve the room for you once your registration is completed and we have received your registration fee.  No booking fee will be charged in advance, however, if the room is cancelled later than xxdate, a cancellation fee will be charged according to our cancellation policy.  It will be deducted from your returned registration fee if the summer school registration is cancelled altogether, or you will be charged the first time you check-in to the summer school.  Please be prepared to pay the full room fee in NT dollars upon your arrival to the Guest House.  The Dong Hua Guest House will not provide their service unless all dues are cleared at time of check-in.
