<h4>Booking Procedure and Room Policies</h4>

<p>Each participant is eligible to request for a bed in the registration questionaire, but the roommate will be assigned by the BioPro2015 organizer.  Please be prepared to share a room with another participant at the NDHU Guest House.  For academic faculties and industrial or international participants traveling with families, it may be possible to book a larger room.  Please contact us at <a href="mailto:biopro2015.favs@gmail.com">biopro2015.favs@gmail.com</a> for your special request.</p>

<p><b>Full accommodation fee should be paid along with the registration fee to secure your booking.</b>  Rooms must be booked for either the whole duration of the summer school (2015/8/24-2015/8/31) or half the duration of the summer school, ie, first half (2015/8/24-2015/8/27) or second half (2015/8/27-2015/8/31). The table below summarizes the choices and corresponding prices. As the NDHU Guest House could be fully-booked quickly during the summer vacation, all participants are suggested to complete their registration and accommodation booking as early as possible. Cancellation can be made before July 31st, 2015.  No refund can be made after this date.</p>
